# Henrik's parsing project
In this project are tools to build LF-parsers from a Backus-Naur-Form like syntax.
This generated parsers can be coupled with a virtual machine to execute arbitrary code.
You can use this project to build simple programming languages that can be executed. 
An [example](examples/simple_stack_based_math.rs) how to do this is in the example folder.

This is an ongoing project and should not be used for anything serious.
